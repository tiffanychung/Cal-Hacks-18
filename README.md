# Cal-Hacks-18

We're a group of freshmen at UC Berkley who are competing in CalHacks November 2018! Our iOS app is called Berkley X Events, and our goal is to graphically display your Facebook events so you know where to go and when to be there.

Right now, we've built it out so that you can see the each event that you are interested in or going to on Facebook is represented by a pin of its location on the app. You can click on a button at the button to expand the filter to see your events from this week or all time. You can also click on an event to see its Facebook URL.
